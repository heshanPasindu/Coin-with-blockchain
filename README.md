🚀 Remix & Hardhat Project
Smart Contract Development with Remix IDE & Hardhat 🛠️
📖 Overview
This repository houses smart contracts developed using Remix IDE and integrated with Hardhat for testing, deployment, and local blockchain development. Our goal is to build, test, and deploy decentralized applications efficiently while maintaining optimized gas costs and secure contract logic.

🧑‍💻 Tech Stack
Solidity - Smart contract development
Remix IDE - Development and initial testing
Hardhat - Local blockchain environment, deployment, and testing framework
Node.js - JavaScript runtime for running Hardhat
Ethers.js - Interaction with the Ethereum blockchain
🚀 Features
Smart Contract Development: Contracts built and deployed on Remix.
Local Development: Set up a local blockchain network with Hardhat.
Testing Suite: Automated tests for contracts using Hardhat.
Gas Optimization: Configurations and optimizations for reducing gas fees.
Contract Deployment: Scripts for deploying contracts to local/test networks.
